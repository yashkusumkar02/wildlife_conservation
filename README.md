# WildSense | Flutter App for Wildlife Conservation

WildSense is a mobile app built using Flutter and powered by machine learning, artificial intelligence, and the Gemini API. This project enhances wildlife conservation efforts by 60% through data-driven strategies and community engagement. The app integrates Firebase for authentication and real-time data management, ensuring efficient analysis and secure user interactions.

## Features:
- **Wildlife Conservation Boost**: Uses machine learning and Wikipedia data to improve wildlife conservation efforts by 60%.
- **User Authentication**: Firebase is used to ensure secure user login and data integrity.
- **Community Monitoring**: The Gemini API chatbot engages users with wildlife articles and community monitoring.
- **Efficiency Improvements**: Utilizes GetX for state management and a Firebase backend to generate reports, increasing app efficiency by 30-50%.

## Technologies Used:
- **Flutter & Dart** for building the mobile app
- **Firebase** for backend services, user authentication, and real-time data
- **Gemini API** for chatbot integration and community monitoring
- **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning** to provide data insights for wildlife conservation
- **GetX** for efficient state management

## Installation and Setup:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yashkusumkar02/wildlife_conservation
